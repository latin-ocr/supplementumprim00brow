To 18th century botanists down to 1776 New Holland (Nova Hollan-
dia) was simply the name of a Section of uninvestigated coast-line on
maps or an obscure South Sea island, seemingly of much less conse-
quence, for example, than little Amboina, and its extraordinary flora
remained virtually unknown until the return in 1771 of JOSEPH BANKs
(1743—1820) and DANIEL SOLANDER (1736—1782) from Captain CooK's
first voyage. Dutch sailors had made known the existence of a long
barren coast-line stretching southward from Arnhem Land to Cape
Leeuwin and then eastward to the Great Australian Bight. They na-
turally surmised that this coast was backed to the east by a gre-at land
mass, but of its extent and its flora, being deepsea men, they knew
nothing. Coox in the Endeavour reached it from the other direction
after circumnavigating New Zealand. On 17 and 18 April 1770 he saw
a southern skua (‘Port Egmont Hen')‚ a bird regarded as a sure sign
of the nearness of land, and the land itself, which he named New South
Wales, carne into sight on 19 April 1770.

Not, however, until 29 April 1770 was Coox able to make a landing
in New South Wales. At the place chosen [g] BANKS and SOLANDER
gathered plants with such enthusiasm and success that, according to
the final version of COOK’S Journal for 6 May 1770 (cf. BEAGLEHOLE, 1955;
ccix, 310), ‘the great quantity of New Plants etc. Mr.BAN1<s & Dr. So-
LANDER collected in this place occasioned my giveing it the name of
Botcmy Bay. It is situated in the Latitude of 340 0’ s, Longitude 2080 37'
West’. Later BANKs recommended the establishment of a penal settle-
ment here. On 6 May 1770, ‘having seen every thing this place afforded'‚
CooK sailed northward, landing next on 23 May at Bustard Bay [h]
on the Queensland coast, then on 29 and 30 May at Thirsty Sound [j]‚
on 8 June on Hinchinbrook Island [k]. Further north, off Cape Tribu-
lation, so named ‘because here began all our troubles’, the Endeavour
struck a coral reef, the Endeavour Reef, on 17 June, and sprang an
alarming leak. Fortunately, the pumps, manned in turn by everyone
aboard, including Coox and BANKs, gained upon the water, the ship
floated off the reef and emergency repairs kept her afloat while the
ship’s boats searched for a harbour where ‘we could repair our defects
and put the ship into a proper trim’. On 18 June 1770 Coox beached
her at the mouth of the Endeavour River [l] and here they remained
until 3 August. BANKs and SOLANDER took full advantage of the oppor-
