LABILLARDIERE published in his Relation du Voyage ὰ la Becherche de
La Petrouse (1799); for notes on his methods of forming generic names,
whereby, for example Chorizonema (referring to the· separate filaments
of the stamens) was ellipsized into the ‘fanciful Greek name' Chorizema,
and Campylonema into Campynema, see HART (1954). ROBERT BROWN
used ellipsis in the same way when publishing Calystegia instead of
Calycostegia in his ProdromuS.

BROWN returned to England in October 1805. About this time JONAs
DRYANDER compiled a catalogue of all the plants of New Holland and
Van Diemen's Island hitherto published (cf. DRYANDER, 1806). It lists
only 370 species of vascular plants, with which may be contrasted the
4200 Australian species estimated by RossERT BROWN as available to him
in 1814, mostly through his own collecting, the 8500 or so (exclusive
of vascular cryptogams) described by ΒΕΝΤΗΑΜ in 1863—78‚ the 8800
listed by FERDINAND VON MUELLER in 1889 and the 12 000 estimated
by J. W. AUDAS as known to occur in Australia in 1950.

FLINDERS'S VOYAGE AND BROWN’S COLLECTING PLACES
IN AUSTRALIA.

RonERT BROWN was born on 21 December 1773 at Montrose‚ Scotland.
He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh without taking a
degree, then in 1795 was commissioned as an Ensign and Assistant
Surgeon in the Fifeshire Regiment of Fencible Infantry. Botany had
long been his absorbing hobby and in 1798, when in London on recruit-
ing service, he used the facilities for study available in the house of Sir
Jossspn BANKS at Soho Square, with its rich herbarium and library and
its erudite botanist-librarian JONAs DRYANDER in attendance. Evidently
impressed by his enthusiasm and ability‚ BANKS (cf. Historical Records
of New South Wales 4: 265) offered BROWN in December 1800 the post
of naturalist aboard H. M. S. Investigator then being fitted out under
the captaincy of MATTHEW FLINDERS for a voyage to New Holland. His
salary was to be {3420 a year. BROWN accepted immediately and came
to London to ascertain in BANKs’s library and herbarium what was then
known about New Holland. He thus set out with a well-prepared mind.
WILLIAM WESTALL was appointed ‘Landscape and Figure Draughtsman’

and FERDINAND BAUER ‘Botanical Draughtsman', both with a salary of
Ξ 315 (Historical Records of New South Wales 4: 804, 344). All signed
