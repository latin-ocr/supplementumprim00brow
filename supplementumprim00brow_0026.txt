lities not previously known on maps. These were evidently prepared
either by F LINDERS in the compilation of his survey notes or by BROWN
and F LINDERS in collaboration. There seems to have been no previous
attempt to correlate all these code names with those on modern maps
or even with the places in the charts published by F LINDERS and re-
ferred to in his text. Such a correlation is now possible because of a
study of the plant descriptions left in manuscript by BROWN and also
because F LINDERS' “original'’ charts have been located in the Mapping
Division of the Admiralty. The former give names in association with
code localities and collecting dateS, while the latter permit a proper
check with recent maps. Copies of the original charts have been obtained
and are now in the herbarium of the Division of Plant Industry,
C. S. Ι. R. O„ Canberra.'

[According to MACK (1958), F L1NDERs evidently decided upon most
of the 250 place-names adopted on his chart not while actively sur-
veying but during his long captivity afterwards. They were thus coined
after he and BROWN had parted and so were never added to BROWN'S
herbarium material]

‘The periods during which code locality names were used are those
during the voyage from King George's Sound [1] to Port Jackson [20]
and from Port Jackson to Arnhem Bay [32] These are denoted, in the
“Prodromus'', by the letters (M) and (T) respectively.

The Investigator arrived at King George's Sound [l], frequently re-
ferred to by BROWN as “Kind George ΙΙΙ. Sound'’‚ early in December,
1801, and remained there until the end of the first week of January,
1802„ The survey then proceeded along the south coast of Westem
Australia and South Australia to Encounter Bay, whose name com-
memorates the meeting with the F rench expedition under BAUDIN. The
French having already surveyed the coast which the Investigator was
now passing, FL1NDERs proceeded direct to King Island [18], which
BAUDIN's party had missed. From there he made for Westernport, but
entered Port Phillip [19] instead. After spending a few days there he
sailed for Port Jackson [20], which was reached on May 9, 1802.

Port Jackson was left late in July and BnowN’s collecting from the ship
recommenced at Sandy Cape [21] on July 81st. Work continued north
to the Cumberland Islands [25], where, on October 18th, the Investi-
gator parted company with the Lacly Nelson, which had accompanied
her from Port Jackson. From here they went north to Murrays' Islands
in Torres Strait and thence to Prince of Wales Islands [26] off the Cape
