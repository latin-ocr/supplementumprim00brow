occasions. By collecting in the Port Jackson region and to the north as
far as the Hunter River, BRowN got another 1000 species. His visit to
Tasmania (Van Diemen’s Island) yielded 700 species. BROWN went there
with the first British settlers, expecting to stay not more than ten weeks,
as he explained in a letter of 12 December 1804 to BANKS (Hist. Rec.
N. S. W. 5: 509), but lack of opportunity to return to Port Jackson
lengthened his visit to nine months. He spent January 1804 near the
mouth of the River Tamar, around George Town (Port Dalrymple), in
the north of the island, the rest of the time at and around Risdon Cove,
near Hobart, and along the River Derwent‚ in the south of the island.
Lacking a boat he could not travel to any great distance from the
settlement. ‘My researches were consequently confined in great measure
to the nearest chain of mountains and the rivers which descend from
thern. Table Mountain *a* I ascended ten times and found it un-
commonly productive, most of the new species acquired in Van Die-
man's Land belonging to it’. Meanwhile BAUER went to Norfolk Island,
where in 1804 and 1805 he collected the plants listed in ENDLICHER’S
Prodromus Florae Norfolkicae (1833). They retumed to England to-
gether aboard the repaired but still damp Investigator, reaching Liver-
pool on 13 October 1805 after ‘a tedious and uncomfortable voyage of
nearly five months'. Having, in BizowN’s words, ‘suffered very consi-
derably from the crazy state of one vessel and the wreck of another’
they thought themseves ‘tolerably fortunate in being able to bring Home
about 3000 species’ (Hist. Rec. N. S. W. 6 z 11).

In his appendix (pp. 533-613) to FLINDERs’s Voyage to Terra Austra-
lis, volume 2 (1814) BROWN gave a summary of the circumstances in
which his collections were formed both during the Investigator’s voyage
and subsequently during his eighteen months in New South Wales and
Tasmania and he also indicated the other sources of material used in
preparing his Prodromus as follows: —

‘The first part of New Holland examined in captain FmNmzns’s voyage
was the South Coast‚ on various and distant points of which, and on
several of its adJ'acent islands we landed, in circumstances more or less
favourable for our researches. The survey of this coast took place from
West to East, and four first anchorage was in King George Third’s Sound
[1], in 35Ο S. lat. and 1180 E. lon. In this port we remained for three
weeks, in the most favourable season for our pursuits; and our collec—
tions of plants made chiefly on its shores and a few miles into the
interior of the country, amount to nearly 500 species, exclusive of those
