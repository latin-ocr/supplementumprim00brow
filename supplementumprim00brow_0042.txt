ABBREVIATIONS USED BY BROWN

Ronmvr Bnova's many citations of botanical literature testify to the
thoroughness with which he surveyed the works of others before pu-
blishing the results of his investigations as new. They include many
books and articles in learned periodicals rarely consulted by later
workers on the Australian flora and some of his referenceS‚ though in-
telligible enough to his contemporaries, are likely to give difficulty
when an attempt is made to check them by means of a modern library
catalogue. Thus the citation ‘Thunb. jap.' can easily be recognized as
referring to CARI. PETER THUNBERG'S Flora Japonz'ca (1784) but it is
not immediately self—evident that ‘nov. act. nat. cur. berol.’ refers to
Der Gesellschaft naturforschender F reunde zu Berlin, neue Schriften.

tification of the works cited by BROWN, references to numbered entries

ry, although information on dates of publication supplementing PRrrZEL's
