as librarian in his place. BANKs‘s great esteem for BROWN is shown by
his will under which he gave to his ‘indefatigable and intelligent libra-
rian RossER'r BROWN, Esq., an annuity of two hundred pounds’ and ‘the
use and enjoyment during his life of my library, herbarium, manuscripts,
drawings, copper-plates engraved, and everything else that is contained
in my collections'‚ the same to pass at BnowN’s death to the Trustees
of the British Museum. BANKs died in 1820. BROWN negotiated with the
Trustees‚ transferred the BANKS1AN collections to the British Museum
in 1827, wisely making terms highly favourable to himself, and was
appointed Keeper of Sir JosEPH BANKs’s Botanical Collections (which
later became the Department of Botany) in the British Museum, with
the status of under-librarian. His immediate task in 1806 was ‘to select
from among his specimens of plants a compleat apartment of one speci-
men at least of every species' for their Lordships of the Admiralty, to
go into the public collection of the British Museum. This occupied him
two days a week, the rest of his time being spent on their determination
and description. The duplicate specimens remained his private property,
since the Admiralty's instructions of 29 April 1801 (Hist. Rec. N. S. W.
4: 351) stated that after specimens and sketches had been applied to
such purposes as their Lordships approved ‘the remainder of the col-
lections of natural history, arms, habits, implements, ornamentS, etc.,
shall be at the disposal of the persons who have collected them'‚ and on
BROWN'S death in 1858 his herbarium passed by bequest to JOHN Jo-
SEPH ΒΕΝΝΕΤΤ (1801-76), then Keeper of the Department of Botany,
who kept it at the British Museum and began the distribution of dupli-
cates. On BENNETT’S death in 1876 the whole became the possession of
the British Museum. As BURB1DGE (1956) has written, ‘During his life·
time BnowN was never particularly generous with his collections. No
specimens were distributed and they could only be consulted after his
personal permission had been obtained for a botanist to visit the British
Museum during certain limited visitors' hours. In his will he appointed
J. J. ΒΕΝΝΕΤΤ, who was his successor at the Museum, as his executor,
and it fell to ΒΕΝΝΕΤΤ to arrange for the distribution of duplicates, a
task which was not completed***. It is these duplicates which are
usually quoted as “types''‚ and it is from the meagre details recorded
on their labels that information as to locality has generally been derived.

Since BROWN did not number his specimens consecutively during the
voyage in the Investigator with MATTHEW F LINDERS, or during the sub-
sequent periods in New South Wales and Tasmania‚ BENNETT added
