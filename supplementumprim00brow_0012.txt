HUMBOLDT and BONPLAND'S plants from Central and South America;
MARTms, who was primarily concerned with the flora of Brazil‚ termed
it a liber aureus. ‘The history of aestivation as a botanical character',
AsA GRAY wrote in 1875, ‘began in Rfssnoqu's ‘'Prodromus Florae Nov.
Holl.’''

Although its sale on publication sadly disappointed BROWN, the merits
of the Proclromus immediately won it the high regard of discriminating
botanists. ‘In point of novelty of plant forms and structures which it
describes, accuracy in details, precision of language‚ wealth of obser-
vations, and far-reaching views of classification’, Sir JOSEPH HOOKER
said in 1888, ‘it maintains to this day the unique position which was
assigned to it on its appearance. F urthermore, it is rightly regarded as
the complement to the great work of Jnssmu in respect of the perfect-
ing and extending the natural system of plants‚ for it modified many of
the JUSSIEUAN families, amplified others by hitherto neglected or mis-
interpreted characters of the highest systematic value, and illustrated
all that were described by observations obtained through a study of
the plants of other countries than Australia‚ and a profound knowledge
of the writings of his predecessors. Ι may cite, as notable examples
of this, his observations under or upon the Orders Marsiliaceae, Grami-
neae, Rutaceae, Scitamineae, Orchideae, Ανοὶάεαε, Cycadeae (where
their plurality of embryos is first indicated), Santalaceae‚ Acanthaceae,
M yrsineae, Epacridecze, Ericeae, and Goodenovz'ae, The ‘Prodromus'
embraces 464 genera, of which nearly one third were described for the
first time, and upwards of 2000 species, three fourths of which were
new to science. *⁹* They are antipodean alike in character and country,
and yet three quarters of a century of further knowledge of the Austra-
lian Flora has in but a few instances disturbed the position, limitation,
or diagnoses of the orders, genera and species contained in the ‘Pro-
dromus’.’ Such an assessment had the more weight in that HOOKER,
by work on his Flora Tus-martiae (2 vols, 1855—60) and with ΒΕΝΤΗΑΜ
on their joint Genera Plantarum (3 vols., 1862—83), had himself dealt
at first hand with much the same material and problems as Brown had
earlier tackled.

The most eloquent contemporary testimony of the esteem which this
work gained for BROWN is the dedication of KUNTH's Synopsis Plan-
tarum vol. 1 (1822), a work devoted entirely to American plants:
