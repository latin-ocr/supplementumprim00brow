York Peninsula where collecting recommenced, there having been
a break from the time at the Cumberland Islands. In the Gulf of Car-
pentaria [27—31] more than four months (early November, 1802, to
early March, 1803) were spent surveying the coasts around to Arnhem
Bay [32]. While in the Gulf it was found that the timbers of the ship
were in a dangerous state of disrepair, and from Arnhem Bay, partly
owing to this and partly to the advancing season of the year, F LINDERs
sailed for Timor. They returned to Port Jackson by circumnavigating
the continent, the only stop being for a brief call at Goose Island Bay
[3] on the south coast of Western Australia. This is recorded by BROWN'S
notes on a few specimenS.

lating the code names with localities on modern maps can now be given.
