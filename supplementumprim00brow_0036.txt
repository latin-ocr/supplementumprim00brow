dated ‘1811' and which according to SHERBORN, Index Animalium
1801—50: xlvii (1922) was published in October 1811: the Council mi-
nutes of the Linnean Society for 5 November 1811 state that ‘vol. lst
of the Memoirs of the Wernerian Society of Natural History was pre-
sented by the Society'. The same volume was listed in M onthly Literary
Advertiser 1811 (74): 43 (10 June 1811) and there can thus be no doubt
that it was issued in 1811, more than a year later than BnowN’s separate
of April 1810.

According to his note, BROWN then sent nine copies of the Prodromus
to Paris for Jussnzu, DESFONTAINES‚ LABILLARDIERE, CORREA, RICHARD,
Bmuvoxs, BONPLAND‚ Du PET1T THouARs and LESCHENAULT. He also
presented copies to Sir JOSEPH ΒΑΝΚε, DRYANDER‚ J. E. ΞΜΙΤΗ, DAWSON
TURNER, LAMBERT, DICKSON, A1TON‚ FERDINAND ΒΑυΕΒ, FRANz ΒΑυΕΒ,
ΚΟΕΝῙΟ, McLEAY, LAw of Edinburgh, the Linnean Society‚ the Wer-
neriam Society of Edinburgh and Trinity College, Dublin. It thus imme-
diately reached botanists able to appreciate its merit. The edition was
small (250 copies), but vastly in excess of the public demand. BROWN'S
intention was to follow it with a second volume and to issue then a ge-
neral survey of the families and genera and an account of Acotyledones
to be placed at the beginning of the work. Evidently he calculated
this would occupy 144 pages. Hence the first page of text is numbered
not 1 but 145. Unfortunately volume 2 and pages 1-144 of volume 1
were never published. The period at the end of the Napoleonic War
was an unfavourable one for natural history books. FRANms BUCHANAN
writing to WAmen in 1817 remarked that in Britain ‘nor is there at
present any encouragement for works on natural history so that the
first volume of BROWN'S Proslromus Florae Novae Hollandiae‚ a most
scientific work, finding no sale whatever, he has stopt short’ (cf. PRMN,
Sketch of the Life of Francis Hamilton (once Buchcznan) xxviii (1905),
prefixed to Αηη. R. Bot. Gard. Calcutta 10 pt. 2).

Mortified by this disappointing response BROWN withdrew the work
from sale. ‘In 18562 according to HOOKER, ‘Mr. BROWN informed me that
the ‘Prodromus' was printed by himself, costing him about εἳ 100, and
that after 26 copies were sold at 18s. each, he recalled all the remaining
copies. 1 made a note of this at the time (1856) and inserted it in a
copy which he gave me in 1839’. Henceforth copies of the original issue
were only available as gifts from the author. Meanwhile, however,
C. G. NEEs VON ESENBECK published a reprint at Niirnberg in 1827 as
Band 3 Abth. 7 of his German edition of BssowN's writings‚ Robert
