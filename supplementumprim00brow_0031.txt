BROWN'S COLLECTING METHODS AND HERBARIUM

ROBERT BROWN was on close terms of friendship with WILLIAM JACK—
SON HOOKER, and when the latter’s twenty-one-year-old son, JOSEPH
DALTON HOOKER (1817—1911) was making ready in 1839 to go as na-
turalist on the Antarctic expedition of H. M. S. Erebus and Terror under
JAMEs CLARI< Ross, he naturally asked BROWN’S advice. The expedition
sailed in September 1839 and returned to England in September 1843.
In 1890 Sir JOSEPH recalled BROWN’S account of the methods he had
used on FLINDERs’s voyage: ‘When preparing myself for a similar voyage
to that he had undertaken, he gave me much information respecting
his own sea-life, together with invaluable advice. Above all things
he told me not only to collect assiduously and in duplicate, but to make
notes and observations on the living plant, and an accessible classified
herbarium of small specimens of every species collected, stowing away
the duplicates in empty rum-casks, headed up, where they should be
safe from damp, rats and insects. It was to this practice of reserving a
working herbarium of the plants he had examined in a fresh state that
he was enabled to employ his time on shipboard in systematically
describing the materials for his ‘Prodromus' *³⁵⁸* When in Australia
I had the privilege of seeing much of Sir JOHN FRANKLIN, then Gover-
nor of Tasmania, who was a midshipman under FLINDERS in the ‘In-
vestigator’, and who became BROWN'S life-long friend. He told me of
BROWN'S extraordinary industry and powers of application‚ whether
when cribbed, cabined, and confined within the lurching and rolling
wooden walls of a sloop of 350 tons, or collecting under the tropica]
sun of the hottest regions in the world. And herein is the secret of the
preparation and publication of the Australian Flora3 the species were,
in great measure at any rate, described as collected in Australia itself,
the descriptions were written out in the homeward voyage, and it only

remained on the return to England to complete the work’ (ΗΟΟΚΕΒ,
1890).

BROWN'S wisdom in dividing his collections became evident when
the Porpoise returning to England with the best set aboard was wrecked
in 1803. Referring to this disaster in a letter to BANKS, BROWN wrote:
‘I possess duplicates of almost all the specimenS, yet those sent were
far the best, belonging to the South Coast, and in consequence the most
valuable that have been collected during the voyage.'

On the death of JONAS DRYANDER in 1810, BANKs appointed BROWN
