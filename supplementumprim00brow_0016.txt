tunity thus given for collecting and by 28 July they had ‘collected every—
thing'. On 11 August Coox landed at Point Lookout [m]‚ on 12 August
on Lizard Island [m]; the northernmost point of Queensland, Cape York‚
was passed on 2lst August. Coox landed next day with BANKS and
SOLANDER on Possession Island [n] and formally ‘hoisted English Cou-
lers and in the Name of His MaJesty King George the Third took posses-
sion of the whole Eastern Coast from the above Latitude [38Ο 3’] down
to this place by the name of Neu> South Wale& together with all the
Bays, Harbours‚ Rivers and Islands situate upon the said coast.’ On
23 August 1770 the Endeavour sailed away from Australia for ever,
reaching Batavia on 10 October 1770 and England on 12 July 1771.

From this short survey of COOK's voyage along the eastern side of
Australia it is evident that most of the botanical specimens collected
there carne from Botany Bay near Sydney‚ New South Wales, and from
the neighbourhood of Cooktown‚ at the mouth of the Endeavour River‚
Queensland.

The material brought back included not only herbarium specimens
(which became part of BANKs's private herbarium and passed to the
British Museum in 1827) and seeds for the Royal Garden at Kew (which
thereby initiated the period of plant introduction into European gardens
termed by GREGOR KRAUS the ‘Zeit der Neuhollander’) but also 955
drawings by SIDNEY PAnmNSON, who died on the voyage in 1771, at
Batavia‚ and a few by HERMAN DIEDRICH SPoRING‚ who died two days
before PARKINSON, and by ALEXANDER ΒΠΟΗΑΝ, who died in 1769, at
Tahiti. Influenced, it would seem, by the insistence of his friend the
antiquary THOMAS F ALCONER (cf. SMITH, 1960: 11) that he should have
a ‘designer’ with him on a proposed tour of Lapland, BANKS thus em-
ployed three artists on the South Sea voyage which took its place. PAR-
K1N80N’s primary task was to portray animals and plants, BUCHAN's to
portray landscapes and people, SPomNG's presumably animals‚ but they
evidently shared tasks. Their work proved of such value not only to
naturalists but also to navigator-s (whose charts they supplemented with
accurate coastal profiles) that on FLINDERs’s voyage later ROBERT BROWN
had as companions likewise two artists, namely FERDINAND BAUER (1760-
1826) and Wumm VVESTALL (1781-1850), the one to record plants and
animals‚ the other scenery. The effect which the naturalists' empirical
approach to nature had upon landscape painting by their artist com-
panions and also upon art generally as a result of these voyages into
the South Pacific is discussed by BERNARD SMITH (1960). BANKs un—
