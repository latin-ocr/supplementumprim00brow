‘General remarks, geographica] and systematical, on the* botany of Terra

Canoniaceae (p. 548), Rhizophoreae (p. 549), Celastrinae (p. 554) and
Stackhouseae (p. 555) and the genera Flindersia (p. 595), Eupomatia
(p. 591) and Eudesmia (p. 599) were first published. It was advertised in

[BROWN's prefatory notes (praemonenda) on pp. vi—viii are in Latin,
like the rest of the Prodromus and, since they give information about
his geographical abbreviations etc. liable to be overlooked, they are
translated below for general convenience, the remarks on this matter
in 1670 by JOHN EACHARD of Cambridge being as relevant now as then.
BROWN‘S adoption here of the term perianthium, as used by MIRBEL,
for the floral leaves of Monocotyledons was unfortunate, as earlier
authors, notably LINNAEUS, had applied this term to the calyx, involu-
cres, spathes and glumes; BROWN’s authority in endorsing this transfer
of application prevented the general acceptance in English—speaking
countries of the more apt term perigonium introduced by F DRIEDRICH
EHRHART in 1788 for the ‘Integumentum genitalium' and widely
used in German-speaking countries. It is worthy of note that BROWN
in his last paragraph declined to accept the view then current that ferns
were monocotyledonous plants, the prothallus being then regarded as a
single cotyledon which became evident on germination.]

Some other remarks concerning the plan of the work will be more fittingly
made in another volume completing the whole work and very soon to be sent
to the press.
