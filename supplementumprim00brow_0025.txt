greater part of the plants brought from Shark's Bay by the celebrated
navigator DAMPIER, and have seen a fe wadditional species from that
and other parts of the West Coast of New Holland, collected in the
voyage of captain BAnmN.

The additional species obtained from all these collections are upwards
of 300; my materials, therefore, for the commencement of a Flora of
Terra Australis amount to about 4200 species; a small number certainly
for a country nearly equal in size to the whole of Europe, but not in-
considerable for the detached portion-s of its shores hitherto examined’.

Unfortunately in the Prodromus BRova did not state the origin of
his material in a precise manner but merely indicated it rather vaguely
by the letters D, J, M, O and T (see maps 1, 2) as explained in his preface:

B denotes specimens collected by BANKS and SOLANDER, i. e. on the coasts of
New South Wales and Queensland between Botany Bay and Possession
Island.

D denotes Insula Van Diemen, i. e. Tasmania, where BizowN collected in
‚1804 around George Town and Hobart (see p. xvi).

J denotes Port Jackson‚ the area from Sydney north to Newcastle‚ New
South Wales, including the Hunter Range, and branches of the River
Hunter.

M denotes Ora Meridionalis‚ i. e. the south coast from Cape Leeuwin‚ West-
ern Australia to the islands of Bass Strait and Wilson's Promontory,
Victoria.

Ο denotes Ora Occidentalis, i. e. &Vestem Australia from Cape Leeuwin
north to the Dampier Archipelago, altough the only specimens seen by
BROWN from this vast coastline were DAMPIER’S (see above) and a few
collected on BAUDiN’s expedition.

T denotes Littus intra Tropicum, i. e. the coast of Queensland and the North-
ern Territory westward to Amhem Bay.

These letters refer to such wide tracts, however, that, as emphasized
by NANCY T. BumnDGE (1956), they are useless for the determination
of type localities. To ascertain these it is necessary to consult BROWN's
original specimens and manuscripts in the Department of Botany, Bri-
tish Museum (Natural History), London. Even so, difficulties may arise‚
as pointed out by BURBIDGE (1956), from whose paper, the result of
critical study in 1953 and 1954 of this material, the following is quoted
here by her kind consent:

‘During his period as naturalist with MATTHEW FmNnEns, in the
Ivnvestigator, BROWN found it necessary to employ code names for loca-
