Brown's vermischte botanische Schriften, providing this with a good
index which refers unfortunately to an added pagination different from
that of the original. It was also reprinted in OKEN’S Isis 1819: 801—984.

The only contemporary review is an anonymous one in the Monthly
Magazine 29: 516 (June 1810), quoted at length by BRITTEN (1922) and
attributed to SAMUEL FREDERICK GRAY, undoubtedly a competent and
well-informed critic. The reviewer began by remarking that ‘in no
book since the publication of JUSSIEU’S Genera Plantarum is there dis-
played such a fund of botanical knowledge as this'. He praised BROWN’s
adoption of a natural system and then gave an explanation of the
missing 144 pages mentioned above: ‘The author promises to give the
diagnosis of his orders, which at present are to be gathered from the
full descriptions prefixed to each, and also contracted generic charac-
ters arranged after the LINNEAN system, with the next volume, but which
are, together with the Acotyledones, to precede the present one. This
circumstance explains the reason of the volume beginning at page 145
appearing, at first sight, as if nine sheets of letterpress had been omitted
or misplaced.’

BROWN’S originality receives due mention: ‘We should be giving a
very false idea of this Flora of New Holland were we to leave it to be
understood, that in following Jussmu, Mr. BROWN has been contented
with copying the characters of the orders, or of such genera as are to
be found there, for his work. On the contrary, everything here is new3
Mr. BnowN’s descriptions of the orders are new, the descriptions of the
genera and species are likewise his own, and every part abounds with
observations equally original and usefu13 nor are these, by any means,
confined to the plants of New Holland, but numbers of them are appli-
cable to botanical science in general.' The view expressed by MARTIUS
and CARRUTHERS that BROWN withdrew the Prodromus from sale on
account of a reviewer's criticism of his Latinity has been shown by
ERITTEN (1907, 1922) to be unfounded.

The public reception of FERDINAND BAUER’s companion work, Illu-
strationes Florae Novae Hollandiae (1813), was equally disappointing,
and after the issue of the third part BAUER abandoned his enterprise of
publishing exquisitely engraved and meticulously accurate hand-colour-
ed illustrations of the new genera and species founded by BROWN in the
Prodromus. The fifteen plates portray 1, Johnsonia lupulina; 2, Pterosty-
lis grandiflora; 3, Banksia coccinea; 4, Chlocmthes stoechadis; 5, styli-
dium violaceum, 6, Aneilema crispata,- 7, Cartonema spicatum; 8, Chilo-
