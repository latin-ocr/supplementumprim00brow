PREPARATION OF BROWN'S ‘PRODROMUS’

The preparation of BROWN’S Prodromus began, in a sense, as soon
as he landed at King George's Sound. ‘My plan', he wrote to BANKS
on 6 August 1803 (cf. Hist. Rec. N. S. W. 5: 182), ‘has been to describe,
as far as time would allow me, every plant we met with, uncertain in
many cases whether those which I was inclin'd to suppose known might
not in reality be new species. The descriptions amount to about 1,600'. As
noted above, Bssown kept handy on board ship a ‘classified herbarium
of small specimens of every species collected' apart from the main col-
lection so that he could study thern continuously during the tedious
months of voyaging on the open sea. ‘In arranging the collection’, he
stated, ‘I at first follow'd JUSSIEU’S Ord’s Naturalis; but I soon found
the plants of doubtful affinity so numerous that I judg’d it better to
use the LINNAEAN method’. It was BROWN'S first-hand experience of the
inadequacies of both systems that led him by his own observations so
much to improve Juseru’s. ’

In a report to WILLIAM MARSDEN, Secretary of the Admiralty, in
January 1806 (cf. Uist. Rec. N. S. W. 6: 19) BANKs recommended, pro-
bably at BROWN’S instigation, that ‘he do with as little delay as possible
publish at his own expense a succinct account of all such plants as he
shall think worthy to be communicated to the public’, receiving a go-
vernment salary while so engaged. BANKS reported on 18 June 1807 (cf.
Hist. Rec. N. S. W. 6: 269) that BROWN spent two days a week selecting
specimens of his for the public collection and that the rest of his time
‘he has been occupied in re—examining the species, in completing his
descriptions, in ascertaining synonyma where necessary, and, lastly, by
examination of the plants already publish'd belonging to the same na-
tural orders, in endeavouring to establish the character and ascertain
the affinities of such in his collection as appear’d to him to constitute
new genera’. By then BROWN had dealt with 688 specieS, among which
546 were considered new, 40 new genera being represented. On 2 June
1809 (cf. Hist. Rec. N. S. W. 7: 160) BROWN stated that he had now
described 1600 specieS, of which 1300 were as yet unpublished‚ with
