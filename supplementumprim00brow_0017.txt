doubtedly intended himself to publish a full illustrated account of the
plants collected on the voyage but he never effected this. Nevertheless
he liberally made his material available to interested persons who
then published it piecemeal and incompletely, which was, how-
ever, better than its not being published at all. For example, descrip-
tions of some of BANKS and SOLANDER’S Australian plants were included
in the younger LINNAEUS'S Supplementum Plantarum (1781) and many
in JOSEPH GAERTNER'S De Fructibus et Seminibus (2 vols„ 1788—92).
The maior study of their material was, however, made by ROBERT
BROWN, who indicated in his Prodromus by the letters ‘B. υ. ss those
species based on specimens gathered by BANKS and SOLANDER. Many
of these had been drawn on the voyage by PARKINSON. Their precise
type-localities and details supplementing BROWN’s diagnoses can be
ascertained from the plates and text reproducing PARKINSON’S illustra-
tions and SOLANDER’S descriptions published in the Illustrations of
Australicm Plants collected in 1770 (cf. BRITTEN, 1905). Thus the type-
locality of lpomoea congesta R. BR„ simply recorded by BnowN as
‘(T.) Β. υ. s.', is at the mouth of the Endeavour River, Queensland (cf.
Illust. Austral. Pl. 65, t. 213).

The establishment of a British penal settlement at Port Jackson in
1788 under Governor PHILIPP led to the· introduction of many of its
plants into European gardens and their illustration here and there
in botanical works as well as the sending to England of further speci-
mens and drawingS. On such a collection made by JonN WHITE, Sur-
geon-General to the settlement at Port Jackson, New South Wales,
JAMES EDWARD SMITH base-d his Specimen of the Bomny of New H olland
(1793—95), tt. 1—4. In this work SMITH remarked (p. 9, under t. 3, Cera-
topetalum gummiferum) that 'when a botanist first enters on the in-
vestigation of so remote a country as New Holland, he finds himself as
it were in a new world. He can scarcely meet with any certain fixed
points from whence to draw his analogies; and even those that appear
most promising, are frequently in danger of misleading, instead of in-
forming him. &Vhole tribes of plants, which at first sight seem familiar
to his acquaintaince‚ as occupying links in Nature's chain, on which
he has been accustomed to depend, prove, on a nearer examination,
total strangers‚ with other configurations, other oeconomy, and other
qualities3 not only all the species that present themselves are new,
but most of the genera, and even natural orders. The plant before us
iustifies the above remarks. Its botanical characters are so new, we
