Wilson Promontory in Bass Strait, including Lewin’s Land, Nuyt’s Land, and
coasts towards the east, first explored by Captain FLINDERS in the ex-
pedition to which I was attached, and a little while afterwards seen by F rench
navigators; with adjacent islands included.

(T) The Coasts of New Holland between the tropics, both eastern and
northern, especially as regards the eastern coast in the neighbourhood of
Endeavour River, and Bay of Inlets‚ which was first explored by the illustrious
BANKS‚ then not long ago from Sandy Cape to the islands called Cumberland
Isles, as well as regards the northern coast Carpentaria and Arnhem's Land,
which I have surveyed on the expedition mentioned above.

(O) The Western Coast from the Lewin Promontory to de Wit Land; of
which some plants had been brought back long ago by Captain Dampier and
a number were without doubt collected recently by F rench travellers, espe-
cially Lechenault and the late Riedley. This letter (T) occurs very rarely‚ for
Ι have not examined any plants from this shore except one or two of Dam—
pier’s and very few collected by the late [Captain Nicolas] Baudin with the

late [Philip Gidley] King then Governor of the Colony and [Lieutenant-Colo-
nel William] Paterson commander of the troops left in New WVales and pre-
served in Banks’s Herbarium or my own.

(D) Van Diemen Island, of which I have visited the Northern and espe-
cially the Southern Regions.

Where several letters occur together, I have arranged these according to the
relative abundanee of the plant within the regions for which they are the
symbols.

The letter B met with on almost every page and added to those mentioned
above, but without brackets, specifies a plant collected on the first voyage of
Cook and up to the present collected only by the illustrious BANKS. He
with his special generosity has not disdained to adorn by his numerous dis-
coveries this effort of mine. which he has helped in every way.

Small letters added to species indicate plants seen by me in a living state
in their country (υ. υ.) or dried (v. 3.), principally in the Banksian Herbarium.

I owe to the friendliness of the travellers Paterson, Menzies and Bauer yet
others, to each of which Ι have added the name of the finder.

Not a few in the beautiful work of the celebrated Labillardiere, which I
have not collected or seen in dried state among the specimens sent by the
author to Lambert, I have introduced simply on his authority and have mar-
ked them by the sign of the obelus (†).

A few Dicotyledones of uncertain position, on account of remarkable or
inadequately studied structure, will be appended to the work; but anomalous
genera of Monocotyledones Ι have attached to the orders to which they seem
to me nearest.

I have placed Ferns with Monocotyledones more because of somewhat simi-
lar growth than on account of any agreement in structure of the seed or
manner of germination; their primordial squamule [i. e. prothallusL inaptly
compared with a true cotyledon, seems to arise entirely out of germination‚
in the same manner as the primordia of Mosses’.
