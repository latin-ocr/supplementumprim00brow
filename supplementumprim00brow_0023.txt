belonging to the class Cryptogamia, which, though certainly bearing
a small proportion to phaenogamous plantS, were not, it must be ad-
mitted, equally attended to. At our *second anchorage, Lucky Bay [2]
of captain F LINDERS’S chart, in 340 S. lat. and about 4Ο to the eastward
of King George's Sound; we remained only three days, but even in that
short time added upwards of 100 species to our former collection.

Goose-Island Bay [3]‚ in the same latitude and hardly one degree to
the eastward of the second anchorage, where our stay was also very
short, afforded us but few new plants3 and the remaining parts of the
South Coast [4—19]‚ on five distant points of which we landed, as well
as on seven of its adJ'acent Islands, were still more barren, altogether
producing only 200 additional species. The smallness of this number is
to be accounted for, partly, no doubt, from the less favourable season
in which this part of the coast was examined; but it appeared to depe-nd
also in a considerable degree on its greater sterility, and especially that
of its islands.

Of New South Wales, or the East Coast of New Holland, scarcely any
part beyond the tropic was examined in the voyage3 our first landing
after leaving Port Jackson [20] being at Sandy Cape [21]‚ in nearly
25Ο S. lat. Between this and 21Ο S. lat. we had many, and upon the
whole, favourable opportunities for observation‚ especially at Port Cur-
tis, Keppel Bay [22], Port Bowen, Strong-tide Passage‚ Shoal-water Bay
[23—24], and Broad Sound [23—24]‚ the survey of which was complet-
ed; we landed also on two of the Northumberland and on one of the
Cumberland Isles [25].

On the North Coast we landed on Good's Island [26]‚ one of the
Prince af Wales’ Isles of captain C001<; for a few hours at Coen River
[27 Ξ Pennefather River], on the east side of the Gulph of Capentaria;
and in more favourable circumstances on many of the islands and some
points of the mainland on the west side of this Gulph. Several of the
group called the Company’s Islands in the chart, the shores of Melville
Bay, of Caledon Bay [31]‚ and a small part of Arnhem Bay [32] were
also examined.

We then left the coast, owing to the decayed state of the ship, which,
on our return to Port Jackson, was surveyed and pronounced unfit for
the prosecution of the voyage.

Captain F LINDERS having, in consequence of this, determined to repair
immediately to England, for the purpose of obtaining another vessel to
complete the obiects of the expedition; Mr. BAUER and myself agreed
