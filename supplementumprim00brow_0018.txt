can scarcely tell to what tribes it is allied; and although, from the pe-
culiar felicity of the LINNAEAN sexual system, founded on parts which
every plant must have, we are at no loss to find its class and order [i. e.
Decandria Monogynia] in that which is an artificial system, we still
scarcely know what genera are its natural allies’. It was the great
triumph of RossERT BnowN that he overcame these difficulties with such
insight and understanding founded on minute observation as to place
the study of Australian plants henceforth on a natural system expressing
significant correlations.

Com< did not touch Australia on his second voyage, on which he was
accompagnied by JOHANN Rssmnom Fonsmz and his son GEoRG
FORSTER (cf. MERILL, 1954: 201—211), but on the third voyage (1776—
1780), in the Resolution, Com< visited Adventure Bay, Tasmania, in Ja-
nuary 1777 and here DAvn) NELSON (d. 1789) and WILLIAM ANDERSON
(d. 1778) collected specimens which passed into BANKs's herbarium.

In 1791 ARCHIBALD MENZIES (1754—1842)‚ surgeon and naturalist on
VANCOUVER'S Discovery, collected specimens in King George’s Sound [d],
Western Australia, which likewise came to BANKs. Next year this s. w.
corner of Western Australia so rich in endemic species (cf. GARDNER,
19443 KEAST, 1960; BURBIDGE, 1960) was visited by a French expedi-
tion, that of D'ENTRECASTEAUX in the ships La Recherche and L'Es-
perance. Here at Esperance Bay (‘in terra van-Leuwin’) [e] in December
1792, and also in Tasmania (‘in capite van-Diemen’) at Storm Bay [f] in
April 1792 and January 1793, the botanist JACQUES JULIEN DE LABILLAR-
Dn'zm: (1755—1834) made the extensive collections which are the basis
of his Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen (vol. 1, 1804—06; vol. 2,
1806—07), a work arranged according to the LINNAEAN sexual system
of classification. The eventful history of these specimens has been out—
lined by DE BEER (196οῑ 45-68). Owing to divided loyalties aboard
the French ships occasioned by the French Revolution Labillardiere
was intemed in Java in 1794 and his collections were dispatched in 1795
to Holland aboard a Dutch ship which was captured by the British and
brought to London in November 1795. On the instructions of the exiled
King Louis XVIII they were presented to the Queen of England. Ulti-
mately‚ however, through the good offices of BANKs, they were sent from
England to Paris, despite the political troubles of the time, and here
LABILLARDIERE received them with joy. His strong curiosity checked
by his yet stronger sense of honour, BANKS even refrained from examin-
ing them. They included many new genera and species, some of which
