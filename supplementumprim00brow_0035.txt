100 genera considered new. ‘Mr. BROWN takes, also, the liberty to state
that he has made some progress in preparing a ProdromuS, in which it
is intended to give the characters of all the new genera, and of such of
those already publish'd as seem to require alteration, together with spe-
cific differences of those genera already finish'd, and of as many others
as he may be able to prepare'. His report of 6 January 1810 (cf. Hist.
Rea. N. S. W. 7: 262) reckoned the number of species as 3,400, out of
which nearly 2200 were described, upwards of 1,700 being new species,
and comprehending 140 new genera. By now he had decided to widen
the scope of his Prodromus so as ‘to include the gene-ric and specific
characters of all the plants known to be natives of New Holland. In
conformity with this plan, nearly one half of the work is prepar'd for
the press, and of the part prepar'd rather more than half is now printed'.
He had then selected about 2,800 specimens for the public collection
(see pp. xxvi, xxvii).

As shown below, the first and only volume of the Prodromus was
published early in April 1810.

PUBLICATION OF BROWN'S ‘PRODROMUS' AND
COGNATE WORKS

BROWN himself paid the cost of printing his Prodromus, which
amounted to fi 93. 14. 4¹s2 d. according to a note by him in a copy now
belonging to the Department of Botany‚ British Museum (Natural
History), London. The same note states that in March he ‘delivered to
MILEs and HUNTER formerly JOHNSON ὅ( Co. St. Pauls Churchyard
20 copies’. The unpublished Council minute-s of the Linnean Society
of London record that on 3 April 1810 ‘Prodromus Florae Novae Hol-
landiae et Insulae Van Diemen autore ROBERTO BROWN and a Paper
on the Asclepiadeae by Mr. BROWN from the Wernerian Transactions
were presented by the Author'. The previous meeting of the Linnean
Society was held on 20 March 1810. The Prodromus was advertised in
the newspaper M orning Post on 7 April 1810 as just published and listed
in WILLIAM BENT's booktrade journal The Monthly Literary Advertiser
1810 (60): 27 ( 10 April 1810) as a newly published work. Thus BROWN’S
Prodromus and reprints (separates) of his paper On the Asclepiadeae, a
natural Order of Plants separated from the Apocineae of Iussieu were
made available at the same time, i. e. in the first week of April 1810.
This paper was subsequently issued in the Memoirs of the Wernerian
Natural History Society vol. 1 (pp. 12—78) of which the titlepage is
