BnowN and BAUER’S collecting localities in Arnhem Land are listed
by R. L. SPECHT (SPECHT & MOUNTFORD‚ 1958: 2) as follows:

4 January 1803 Mainland opposite Groote Eylandt

14 -—— Chasm Island, off Groote Eylandt
15 — North West Bay, Groote Eylandt
16 -« Winchelsea Island‚ off Groote Eylandt

4-6 February 1803 Caledon Bay
9 —- Middle Point‚ Caledon Bay

14 — Point Dundas, Melville Bay
16 -- Islet near Drimmie Head, Melville Bay
19—22 —— Cotton’s, Pobasso's and Astell’s Islands, in Malay Road

2-4 March 1808 Cape Newbald and parts of Arnhem Bay.

The thoroughness of their collecting is attested by the large number
of species recorded by SPECHT (1958) from Arnhem Land for which
Ἥ. BR? stands as the author of the specific epithet‚ BROWN having first
detected and named the species concerned.

WILLIS (1959) has listed the 48 species collected by BROWN in June
1802 and May 1803 on Middle Island, in the Recherche Archipelago (3),
Goose Island Bay.

BROWN was 3 competent zoologist as well 33 botanist. His zoological
notes and descriptions in the Department of Zoology, British Museum
(Natural History) reveal that he djssected and examined his zoological
materIal with the same 2031 that he studied plants. From these it appears
that the duck-billed platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) figured by
BAUER (cf. STEARN, 1960: fig. 3) was found at Port Jackson and the
Koala (Phaseolczrctos cinereus) in woods near Hat Hill, New South
NVales. They deal with mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects (con-
cerning which, see TRANS. LINNEAN Soc. LONDON 12: 454—4783 1818)
and other invertcbrates.
