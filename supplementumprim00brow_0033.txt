numbers to all the material [forming the BROWN bequest], and a full
list of these is in the botanical library of the British Museum (Natural
History) in South Kensington. Unfortunately these numbers were re-
lated to the names of species in the “Prodromus'' rather than to indi-
vidual specimens. Consequently there are cases in which the same
number has been applied to specimens from different localities and it
will be necessary to select lectotypes in such instances. For example,
in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, there are two
BROWN specimens of Atriplex semibaccata under the same BENNETT
number, though one is from “Port Jackson'' and the other from a lo-
cality on the Queensland coast.' (BURBIDGE, 1956: 229).

From the above it will be evident that, excluding the specimens lost
in the wreck of the Porpoise, there existed of most of BnowN’s gatherings
several specimens, one being the small specimen which he kept apart
for study during the voyage, the others being those which were stored
in casks. These have subsequently been mounted together at the British
Museum without distinction and it may be difficult to determine the
history of a particular specimen, i. e. whether it formed part of BROWN's
study set or the main set. How far BROWN got in selecting specimens
for the public collection (see p. xxvi) is uncertain: lack of public interest
in his Prodromus may well have led him to stop work and leave both
uncompleted at the same time. The specimen chosen for the public
collection seems to be the best one available, mounted on bluish paper
and inscribed on the back of the sheet at the top with a note as to its
provenance and collector, e. g. ‘Nova Hollandia, Port Jackson,
Mr. BROWN'. These sheets may be of special value for typification. They
lack the numbers mentioned above which ΒΕΝΝΕΤΤ added to the speci-
mens from the BROWN bequest. Some such specimens have been
presented to other institutions, with a printed blue label ‘Ex Herbaria
Musei Britannici', having been regarded in the past simply as dupli-
cates of the smaller and more numerous specimens from BROWN's pri—
vate herbarium acquired through the BENNETT bequest which are now
mounted, often several different gatherings together, on sheets bearing
the printed blue label headed <Β. BROWN, Iter Australiense, 1802—5
[Presented by direction of J. J. ΒΕΝΝΕΤΤ, 1876.] Νο.’ All are authentic
specimens (syntypes); as BROWN re-examined his material before pu-
blishing the Prodromus it seems wise to select as the lectotype of a
BROWNian species the most complete individual specimen in the British
