THE IMPORTANCE OF BROWN'S ‘PRODROMUS'

The forerunner of GEORGE BENTHAM'S monumenta] Flora Australien-
sis (7 vols„ 1868—78)‚ ROBERT BROWN’S Prodromus Florae Novae Hol-
landiae et Insulae Van-Diemen (1810) has a two—fold importance in the
history of systematic botany. Its primary purpose was to record succinct-
ly the plants of Australia collected by ROBERT BROWN himself in 1802
to 1805 when naturalist on F LINDERs's voyage, together with plants
collected earlier by JOSEPH BANKs and DANIEL SOLANDER on CooK’s
first voyage (1768—71)‚ those introduced into cultivation meanwhile,
mostly from around Port Jackson (Sydney), and a few from other sources.
The many new genera and species named by BROWN in this book make
reference to it continually necessary for workers on the Australian flora.
However to BROWN'S contemporarieS‚ few of whom had any interest in
Australian plants as such, the importance of BROWN'S Proclromus lay in
its adoption of a natural system of classification based on that of ΑΝ-
TOINE LAURENT DE Jussmu's Genera Plantarurn secundum Ordines natu-
rales disposita (1789) as opposed to the popular artificial ‘sexual system’
of classification taken from LINNAEUS; BROWN'S Prodrornus and AUG.
P. DE CANDoLLE's Flore franoaise (1805) were the first major floristic
works so arranged. Moreover BROWN’S founding of new families and
genera and his inclusion of pertinent observations on those already
known gave it an importance and interest reaching from Australia to
northern Europe and northern Asia: it helped KUNTH in his work on
