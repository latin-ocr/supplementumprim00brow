glottis diphylla; 9, Greoillea Banksii; 10, Brunonia sericea; 11, Tricoryne
(Λατίου 12-14, Doryanthes excelsa; 15, Stylidium calcaratum, S. pyg-
maeum, Leuenlzookia pusilla. Parts 1 and 2, containing plates 1—10‚
were issued together, part 3 later. Apparently the edition was less than
50 copies. These plates are among the most beautiful illustrations of
Australian plants ever published.

BnowN also published in 1810 his celebrated paper ‘On the Protea-
ceae of Jussieu' in Trans. Linn. Soc. London 10: 15—226. This paper
was read to the Society on 17 January 1809; the titlepage of volume 10
is dated ‘l.811'; part 1 (pp. 1—228) was, however, ready for delivery
to members of the Linnean Society in February 1810 (according to the
Society’s Council Minutes) and was received by the Royal Society on
1 March 1810 (cf. Phil. Trans. 100: 321); thus it came out before the
Prodromus. The Royal Society received part 2 (pp. 229—415) on
7 November 1811 (cf. Phil. Trans. 102: 417); this contains EDWARD
RUDGE'S ‘A description of several species of plants from New Holland’
(pp. 283—303) and SMITH’s ‘An account of a new genus of New Hol-
land plants named Brunonia‘ (pp. 365-370)‚ which thus appeared after
the publication of Brauronia in the Proclromus Meanwhile RICHARD AN-
THONY SALISBURY had stolen a march upon BROWN by publishing other
names for many of his plants in JOSEPH KNIGHT'S On the Cultivation
of the Plam‘s belonging το the Natural Order of Promeae (1809; the
preface and plate dated ‘1. August 1809‘). Knight had formerly been
head gardener to GEORGE HIBBERT, who, according to Bnowrr, ‘for many
years possessed the most extensive collection of living Proteas that has
ever been formed'.

That SALISBURY wrote most of the Proteeae is evident from KNIGHT'S
reference in his preface to ‘R. A. SAL1SBURY‚ Esq.‚ whose manuscripts
have been found so useful in every sheet' and indeed from the text itself.
It was to the prior publication of KNIGHT and SALISBURY’S book that
SAMUEL Coomzxoucn, Bishop of Carlisle‚ refered in a letter of 26 De-
cember 1809 to J. E. SMITH: ‘How shocked I was to see SALISBURY’S
surreptitious anticipation of BROWN's paper on the New-Holland plants,
under the name and disguise of Mr. H1BBERT’s gardener! *⁴⁵* I think
SALisssuRY is got ⁹⁶⁶ to that point of shameful doing when no good man
could be found to defend him’. The nomenclatural consequences are
discussed by J. BRITTEN in J. Bor. (London) 24: 296—300 (1886).
