to remain in the colony of New South Wales, until his return, or, if that
should not take place, for a period not exceeding eighteen months.
During this time we added very considerably to our collections of plantS‚
within the limits of the. Colony of Port Jackson and its dependent settle-
ments3 the banks of the principal rivers and some part of the mountains
bounding the colony were examined3 I visited also the north and south
extremities of Van Diemen‘s Land, remaining several months in the
vicinity of the river Derwent; and repeatedly landed on Kent’s Islands,
in Bass' Strait, on the shores of which the principa] part of the Sub-
marine Algae contained in our collections were found.

The reader of captain F LINDERS'S narrative is already acquainted with
the unfortunate circumstances that prevented his revisting Port Jack—
son within the expected period, soon after the expiration of which we
embraced an opportunity of returning to England, where we arrived in
Oktober 1805, with the greater part of our collecions‚ and without
having absolutely lost any one species3 though many of our best speci-
mens of the South Coast, and all the living plants collected in the voyage
perished in the wreck of the Porpoise.

The collection of Australian plants thus formed amounts to nearly
3900 species. But before embarking in the voyage of captain F LINDERS,
Ι enjoyed no common advantages, through the liberality of Sir JOSEPH
ΒΑΝΚ3, in whose Herbarium I had not only access to nearly the whole
of the species of plants previously brought from Terra Australis, but
received specimens of all those of which there were duplicates. Of these
plants‚ exceeding 1000 species, the far greater part were collected by
Sir JOSEPH BANKs himself, in the voyage in which New South Wales
was discovered. The rest were found at Adventure Bay in Van Diemen's
Land, by Mr. DAvm NELSON, in the third voyage of captain C00K3 at
King George’s Sound on the south-west coast of New Holland, by
Mr. ΜΕΝΖΙΕ3, in captain VANCOUVER'S voyage3 and in the colony of
New South VVales by several botanists‚ especially the late colonel
PATERSON and Dr. DAVID BURTON. Since my return from New Holland
I have had opportunities of examining‚ in the same Herbarium, many
new species, found in New South Wales by Mr. GEORGE Cum, an
acute and indefatigable botanist, who resided nearly ten years in that
colony; and have received from the late colonel PATERSON several spe-
cies discovered by himself within the limits of the colony of Port Dal-

rymple; which was established under his command.
Ι have also examined, in the Sherardian Herbarium at Oxford, the
